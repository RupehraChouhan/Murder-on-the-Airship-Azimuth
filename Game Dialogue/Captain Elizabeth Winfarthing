[Tell me about yourself.]
	C: I'm the skipper of the (i)Azimuth(/i). Sixteen years before the gasbag. 
[What is your connection to the victim?]
	C: He built this ship and owns the line, so he does pay my wages. That said, since I welcomed him and his party on board, we haven't spoken. I and my crew have been busy non-stop keeping us aloft. Except for my steward, Miss Newport - she's been away from her post a fair bit lately.
[What did you see last night?]
	C: We flew through a stormcloud, so I didn't leave the wheel from half-past-seven until almost nine. It's all there in my logbook, and my crew can attest to that. If anyone came through the observation deck during that time, I wouldn't have noticed. After it blew over, I had a word with Mr. de la Rocque. Routine scheduling and maintenance discussion. I glanced up after 9:30 and saw Lady Eleanora and Sergeant-Major Ritter taking in the view.
[Ask about a discovery.]
	[Wound]
		C: I run a tight ship. Nothing big and heavy should have been accessible to the passengers unless they smuggled it in under their clothes. If they went out-of-bounds, they might have found something in the engine room or the cargo bay.
	[Time of Death]
		C: Between 8:30 and 9 we were still in the grips of that storm. I was stuck to the wheel. If anyone came through, I wouldn't have noticed until the storm passed.
	[Weapon]
		C: Ah, blast it. The responsonomic baro-regulator. Should have known. Let's get that reattached before we lose boiler pressure.
	[Bishop's Spectacles]
		C: I'm not sure what you want me to say about those.
	[Rook's Contracts]
		C: Looks like de la Rocque handled most of the minutiae here. Not surprised. He always takes an interest in the day-to-day when he travels with us.
	[Pawn's Political Tracts]
		C: Whose is this? Did anyone see you find this? If management hears we've got Singerist propaganda on board, lots of good airmen could lose their jobs.
	[Knight's Service Record]
		C: Well, I knew he was a big hero, but I never knew exactly for what. Now I know why he doesn't go around boasting. No one wants to boast about Rosenfeldt.
		Y: Rosenfeldt?
		C: The first use of skyships in war. Three boats much like this one, minus all the mahogany.
		N: {i}Captain Winfarthing shakes her head solemnly.{/i}
		C: They crewed them with raw recruits out of the naval college. The {i}naval{/i} college. They weren't aeronauts. They didn't have a prayer.
		C: Got caught by some crosswinds, lost their position, ended up dropping their bombs on a regiment of Her Infallible Majesty's crack infantry. Then, when the Rurovians turned their guns on them...
		C: They {i}became{/i} the bombs.
		N: {i}Captain Winfarthing shudders.{/i}
		C: Anyone surviving Rosenfeldt got sent home with medals. I doubt it's enough.
	[Hiding Places]
		C: I've had my men search all the usual contraband stashes. Nothing. Means there's one out there I don't know about. It {i}didn't{/i} go over the side, I can be sure of that. My instruments would have told me if we lost interior pressure. No worries there.
		
[Ask about the passengers.]
	C: Given the prestige of our passengers, I've had the... pleasure of speaking with them personally.
	C: As for Royaume, the, ah, victim, I don't know anything more than what you read in the papers. He owns this ship, he owns the whole airship line. He was headed to Endsville to sign the biggest contract Her Infallible Majesty's government has ever offered, selling war zeppelins to the Brigades. 
	C: His wife, Baroness Eleanora is on board as well. Things are chilly between them, but if you keep up with the society pages, you'll know that's nothing new. 
	C: Travelling with them is Mr. de la Rocque who is - was - Royaume's solicitor and business partner. We also have Colonel Angus Ritter, the war hero, and Rector Nathaniel Esgob, the social reformer. I understand he's on a speaking tour. 
	C: Finally, though I hate to think it, one of my crew was not accounted for early this evening. My steward, Newport, was not at her post last night. I've taken the liberty of confining her to the passenger quarters with the other suspects. I hope you can resolve this swiftly and discreetly.
