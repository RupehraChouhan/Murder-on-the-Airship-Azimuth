[Tell me about yourself.]
	N: (i)Esgob steadies himself. His face is flushed and he reeks of liquor. Despite this, his eyes are lucid and frightened. Perhaps the shock has sobered him up.(/i)
	B: Rector Nathaniel Esgob, of the Compassionate Reform Crusade. 
	Y: And what is that?
	B: It's a social movement. We're seeking, well, um, compassionate reform. Particularly in our nation's industrial sites. Seeking to ban child labour, encouraging temperance, that kind of thing.
[What is your connection to the victim?]
	B: We hadn't met in person before. I've written him many letters, talking about the deplorable conditions in his factories... I always received very noncommittal replies, usually from the desk of Mr. de la Rocque.
	B: I doubt Royaume even read them.
	[Pressure]
		Y: That must have been frustrating.
		B: Detective, I see what you're implying! I didn't kill him. I-I couldn't ever even think of such a thing! I'm a pacifist, for heaven's sake! Ask me your questions when you're several degrees more sensible!
		[END] 
	[Ask something else.]
[What did you see last night?]
	B: After dinner, I - uh, I retired to my room for a spell. Then I went back to the dining room. I, um, had forgot my reading glasses. That was about 8:30. Then I must have got turned around, I ended up in the bar at 9. The steward was tidying up when I arrived. She invited me for coffee and cigars in the dining room at 9:30, which I had just sat down to enjoy when I heard her scream! Mr. de la Rocque and I went running, and we found her staring in shock at that poor man... 
	[Pressure]
		Y: Anything you'd like to add?
		B: I'm not sure what you mean.
		Y: I don't think you're telling me everything.
		N: {Esgob visibly shakes.}
		B: You're right! I didn't go to my cabin after dinner! I stopped in the bar. It calms my nerves! I've never flown before, it's quite alarming! Please don't tell my supporters in the temperance movmement!
		Y: Why did you lie to me, Rector?
		B: I... Lady Eleanora was there, and I'd just argued with Mr. Royaume, and I... I thought it would appear unseemly if I admitted to drinking with another man's wife shortly before he turned up dead.
		Y: More unseemly than being caught lying to the detective trying to solve that murder?
		B: Are you even attached at all to the police?
		Y: No, I am merely an accomplished amateur.
		B: Then I don't have to answer any more of your questions.
		[END]

[Ask about a discovery.]
	[Wound]
		B: Oh, how dreadful. A heavy bludgeon, you say? Haven't seen anything like that.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Are you quite certain? It's a large ship...
			B: Yes, I'm certain!
			N: (i)Esgob regains his composure and looks up at you, worriedly. He holds out a shaking hand.(/i)
			R: Look at this, Detective. Shaking like a leaf. I've been a nervous wreck since we came aboard. First time flying. Do you think I have the strength to swing such a thing?
		[Ask something else.]
	[Time of Death]
		B: Between 8:30 and 9 I was in the dining room. I'd misplaced my spectacles. They - aheh - they took some finding.
		N: {i}Rector Esgob is not currently wearing spectacles.{/i}
		[Pressure]
			Y: You're not wearing them now.
			N: {i}Esgob pats his breast pockets.{/i}
			B: Oh, blast. Mislaid them again. Where could they be this time?
			Y: Also, do you expect me to believe it takes a whole half-hour to find your spectacles?
			B: I suspect some assiduous servant moved them. Somewhere. If you were half as assiduous, you'd be finding a killer, not haranguing me about my spectacles!
			[END]
		[Ask something else]
	[Weapon]
		B: Oh, how ghastly!
		[Pressure]
			Y: It was found in the galley. Any chance you passed by there earlier?
			B: Detective, I've accounted for my whereabouts! Have I lied to you yet?
			Y: Probably.
			B: This isn't amusing, Detective. I have tried my best to help you do the right thing and you insist on bedeviling me! Return when you see fit to take this seriously!
			[END]
		[Ask something else]
	[Hiding Places]
		B: I'm afraid I'm not much use in finding hidden corners, Detective. I misplaced my spectacles earlier tonight. 
		[Pressure]
			Y: Indulge me for a moment, Rector. Imagine I'm the murderer. I strike Mr. Royaume in the baths, there's blood on my hands, I search around for a hiding place. Where do I look?
			B: I- I wouldn't know! I've never even seen a dead body! Read about them plenty. Besides, it's my first time on one of these wretched skyships! I wouldn't know what to look for!
		[Ask something else]
	[Bishop's Spectacles]
		B: Ah, you found my spectacles! Thank you!
		[Pressure]
			Y: I found them in the dining room. You said you already found them there.
			B: Well, yes. Then I went back later. They were, ah, serving coffee. I must have... lost them again. Then. There.
		[Ask something else]

	[Rook's Contracts]
		B: I'm afraid this sort of thing is beyond me. I've helped draft charters of labour rights, but I kept the language plain. You know. For the working classes.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Is it fair for me to say you were against this deal?
			B: Yes, all it means is more money in the pockets of Royaume while his workers suffer in intolerable conditions! Perhaps his partner, de la Rocque will be more amenable to reform...
			N: {i}It dawns on Esgob what he is saying.{/i}
			B: I - I didn't mean it like that! Maybe - maybe you should come back later, Detective. When I've had a chance to collect myself.
			[END]
		[Ask something else]
	[Pawn's Political Tracts]
		B: I'm no Singerist! Of course we both want better conditions for workers, but revolution isn't the answer! Surely, by appealing to industrialists' sense of humanity, by showing them the conditions that exist in their factories...
		B: That's beside the point. What does it have to do with the... killing, though?
		[Pressure]
			Y: I was hoping you might tell me.
			B: Detective, my objections to the maltreatment of workers are moderate and pacifistic. Singer's call for violent revolution does the workers more harm than good. You're barking up the wrong tree. Find that book's owner, you'll find a madman with a motive.
		[Ask something else]
	[Knight's Service Record]
		B: Very impressive, I'm sure. I value his service, even if I object to our involvement in foreign wars.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Ritter was at the battle of Rosenfeldt. Does that mean anything to you?
			B: I understand it was a disaster, but I don't know much else. My area of expertise is {i}domestic{/i} suffering, I'm afraid.
		[Ask something else]
	[Rook's Body]
		B: My heavens! Not de la Rocque! He was... a more temperate man than his late partner. I had thought... never mind that. Am I in danger?
		[Pressure]
			Y: I doubt it. You're a healthy enough specimen. Why, I'd wager you could overpower de la Rocque. He wasn't an athletic man, nor was he in his prime.
			N: {i}Esgob looks queasy{/i}
			B: The suggestion is repulsive, detective! I - I'm not capable of such a sin! The very idea - sickening!
			N: {i}Nausea threatens to overcome him.{/i}
			B: Perhaps... come back later? When I'm a bit more *urk* composed.
			[END]
		[Ask something else]

[Ask about another suspect.]
	[Queen]
		B: Lady Eleanora is charming, of course, but has no conception of the plights of the masses, as most of her aristocratic peers don't.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Do you think she's capable of murder?
			B: Detective, if you'd asked me this afternoon, I'd have said none of us is capable of murder... Are we certain it wasn't an accident?
		[Ask something else]
	[Rook]
		B: Not to speak ill of the dead, but de la Rocque is much more agreeable than Mr. Royaume. Very diplomatic. I gather he didn't care much for me, but he at least took the time to listen. I had thought... Never mind.
		[Pressure]
			Y: In your estimation, could he be responsible for the murder?
			B: You know, he could be! It takes a particularly immoral man to express sympathy at my letters about his workers' suffering but do nothing to alleviate it. I had thought it was just because he was the junior partner, without any real power, but now that you mention it... Hmmmm.
		[Ask something else]
	[Knight]
		B: I don't know much about Sergeant-Major Ritter. We'd never met before, and he's quite taciturn.
		[Pressure]
			Y: In your estimation, is he capable of murder?
			B: Well. He is the only one here who has killed before. In service to the Crown, for sure, but... No. He's an honourable man, I'd say. 
		[Ask something else]
	[Pawn]
		B: I can't believe Miss Newport is under investigation. She's as dedicated as any on this crew. She was putting in extra effort to see we were well cared-for.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Maybe that wasn't dedication. Maybe that was fear.
			B: Fear? Fear of what?
			Y: Losing her post.
			B: If she didn't wait on us upper-crust passengers, you mean? It's very possible. There's always more desperate souls looking for work that isn't the factories. I have no trouble believing Royaume would fire her in an instant if someone who'd do more work for less came along.
