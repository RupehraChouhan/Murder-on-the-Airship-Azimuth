[Tell me about yourself.]
	N: (i)Esgob steadies himself. His face is flushed and he reeks of liquor. Despite this, his eyes are lucid and frightened. Perhaps the shock has sobered him up.(/i)
	B: Rector Nathaniel Esgob, of the Compassionate Reform Crusade. 
	Y: And what is that?
	B: It's a social movement. We're seeking, well, um, compassionate reform. Particularly in our nation's industrial sites. Seeking to ban child labour, encouraging temperance, that kind of thing.
[What is your connection to the victim?]
	B: We hadn't met in person before.
	[Pressure]
		Y: That was the extent of your connection?
		B: 
	[Ask something else.]
[What did you see last night?]
	B: After dinner, I - uh, I retired to my rooms for a spell. Then I went back to the dining room. I, um, had forgot my reading glasses. That was about 8:30. Then I must have got turned around, I ended up in the bar at 9. The steward was tidying up when I arrived. She invited me for coffee and cigars in the dining room at 9:30, which I had just sat down to enjoy when I heard her scream! Mr. de la Rocque and I went running, and we found her staring in shock at that poor man... 
	[Pressure]
		Y: Anything you'd like to add?
		B: I'm not sure what you mean.
		Y: I don't think you're telling me everything.
		N: {Esgob visibly shakes.}
		B: You're right! I didn't go to my cabin after dinner! I stopped in the bar. It calms my nerves! I've never flown before, it's quite alarming! Please don't tell my supporters in the temperance movmement!
		Y: Why did you lie to me, Rector?
		B: I... Lady Eleanora was there, and I'd just argued with Mr. Royaume, and I... I thought it would appear unseemly if I admitted to drinking with another man's wife shortly before he turned up dead.

[Ask about a discovery.]
	[Wound]
		B: From the look I got, I'd agree. A decent length of steel, you don't need much strength to crack a man's skull.
		[Pressure]
			Y: You seem to know a lot about this.
			B: I was a soldier, Detective. I've seen killing. War's not clean, like they make it look in the paintings.
			N: (i)Ritter gives you a long, level stare.(/i)
			R: I didn't kill him, Detective. I didn't even know him.
		[Ask something else.]
	[Time of Death]
		B: Between 8:30 and 9 I was in my cabin. Alone.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Did you see anything, hear anything?
			B: No, I'm afraid not, Detective.
		[Ask something else]
	[Weapon]
		B: Found it, did you?
		[Pressure]
			Y: You seem awfully collected about this whole affair.
			B: How precisely should I react, Detective? I've seen men die before. More even than you in your illustrious career. If suspicious insinuations and your intuitions about character are the extent of your investigative skills, I am appalled that your reputation is as great as it is.
		[Ask something else]

	[Hiding Places]
		B: I will say this for Royaume's ships - they are efficient. Very little wasted space and material, even in these ostentatious luxury decks. I haven't noticed anywere one could hide a weapon, Detective, I'm sorry.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Indulge me for a moment, Sergeant-Major. Imagine I'm the murderer. I strike Mr. Royaume in the baths, there's blood on my hands, I search around for a hiding place. Where do I look?
			B: I'm afraid I can't help you. Cowardly attacks such as this are not a soldier's specialty. I suggest you ask these questions of someone with something to gain from Mr. Royaume's death. [END]
		[Ask something else]
	[Bishop's Spectacles]
		B: Esgob's spectacles. What of them?
		[Pressure]
			Y: When you saw him, was he wearing them?
			B: At dinner, yes. I didn't see him again until the body was found.
		[Ask something else]

	[Rook's Contracts]
		B: I've already seen these. Mr. de la Rocque asked me to consult on the language, you know. He thought the sponsorship of a decorated soldier might aid him in dealing with the Admiralty.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Confidentially, is there anything untoward about this deal?
			B: I think it's misguided. I think it's naked profiteering. But it's entirely above-board, legally speaking. 
			Y: Did you mention your reservations to Royaume?
			B: Based on those documents, it's de la Rocque to whom I should have brought them. Every word of them save the signatures was his. 
		[Ask something else]
	[Pawn's Political Tracts]
		B: I don't get involved in politics. I have dedicated my life to service of Her Infallible Majesty's government, whatever that government may be.
		[Pressure]
			Y: It might have something to do with Royaume's death. Would any of your fellow passengers be at all receptive to this kind of ideology?
			N: (i)Ritter gives you a level stare.(/i)
			B: I said I don't get involved in politics.
		[Ask something else]
	[Knight's Service Record]
		B: My whole life is in there. Does that help answer your questions?
		[Pressure]
			Y: I understand you were at the Battle of Rosenfeldt?
			N: (i)Ritter draws a quick breath.(/i)
			B: And?
			Y: It says your regiment was decimated by airborne bombing. Friendly airborne bombing. From a Royaume-made war zeppelin. The same kind that Royaume is trying to sell to the Admiralty in quantity.
			N: (i)Ritter speaks through gritted teeth.(/i)
			B: Are you accusing me of murder, Detective?
			Y: That remains to be seen. [END]
		[Ask something else]
	[Rook's Body]
		B: Thank you for your concern, Detective, but I am unharmed. If the killer comes for me next, I am prepared to defend myself.
		[Pressure]
			Y: And if that killer is you, Sergeant-Major?
			N: (i)There is a long pause. Ritter's face is calm.(/i)
			B: Then I suppose you'd best lock me away, Detective. After you find some proof, that is.[END]
		[Ask something else]

[Ask about another suspect.]
	[Queen]
		B: The Lady Eleanora? I've only just met her. She seems the picture of decorum.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Do you think she's capable of murder?
			B: She clearly did not love him. And I imagine she stands to inherit a fortune. Many more men have died for worse reasons.
		[Ask something else]
	[Rook]
		B: de la Rocque, the solicitor? A diligent man. What about him?
		[Pressure]
			Y: In your estimation, could he be responsible for the murder?
			N: (i)Ritter's brow furrows.(/i)
			B: I suppose. He's worked long in Royaume's shadow without a trace of ambition. But perhaps branching out into arms dealing has soured his morals some.
		[Ask something else]
	[Bishop]
		B: Rector Esgob, the social reformer? A principled man. Willing to defend those principles, if suppertime's heated debate was any indication.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Would he kill to defend those principles?
			B: I doubt it. The man's many things, but he's no hypocrite. That said, he did have a lot to drink. If he'd had a few more, there's no predicting what he'd do. 
		[Ask something else]
	[Pawn]
		B: The steward? She seems dutiful enough. She insisted on attending to her duties even in the face of the Royaumes' demands for personal attention.
		[Pressure]
			Y: Could that have driven her to murder?
			B: Doubtful, in my opinion. She's rank-and-file. She's accustomed to those in charge not knowing what they're doing and giving her orders anyway.
