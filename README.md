# STS350
Text Adventure

When we are ready to put images into our game, they must go in the game/images/ directory.

This is the Ren'Py project folder for the game. To play the game, download the latest version of Ren'Py from http://www.renpy.org/latest.html and place this project into it's root directory. Ren'Py should automatically recognize the project, and you should be able to launch it by clicking "Launch Project" in the bottom right while runnnig Ren'Py with the game selected. If it does not recognize it even after hitting refresh, or if you want to change where you want to put Ren'Py projects, click "preferences" also in the bottom right and change the projects directory to the location of your choosing.
